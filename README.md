# Dice Roll Decision Maker

A tool hacked together quickly to help with decision making. 
  
Provide a list of choices using the -c command line argument, and a randomly chosen one will be returned.  
List of choices can be of any length.  
  
## Todo:
1. Multiple rolls until a choice is selected option.
1. Tournament style - keep rolling, eliminate choices until one remains.
1. Have the dice min start from zero, no need to deduct 1 from returned roll result.
1. Prompt user if he's happy with result, allow re-rolling or altering choices.
1. Pretty print multiRoll / Tournament style results.
